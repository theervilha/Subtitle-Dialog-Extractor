matrix;a team nanban (594mgnav) release - is everything in place? - you aren't supposed to relieve me. i know, but i felt like taking a shift. you like him, don't you? you like watching him. - don't be ridiculous. - we're gonna kill him. you understand that? morpheus believes he is the one.;00:00:04,594 -->   00:01:04,354
matrix;do you? it doesn't matter what i believe. you know, do you? - did you hear that? - hear what? are you sure this line is clean? yeah, of course i'm sure. i better go.;00:01:04,522 -->   00:01:17,659
matrix;"- freeze! police! - hands on your head! do it! do it now! - lieutenant. - oh, shit. lieutenant, you were given specific orders. i'm just doing my job. you give me that ""juris-my-dick-tion"" crap, you can cram it up your ass. the orders were for your protection. i think we can handle one little girl.";00:01:55,615 -->   00:02:40,784
matrix;i sent two units! they're bringing her down now! no, lieutenant, your men are already dead. shit. morpheus, the line was traced. i don't know how. i know. they cut the hard line. there's no time. get to another exit. - are there any agents? - yes. goddamn it. you have to focus, trinity. there's a phone at wells and lake. you can make it. - all right. - go. that's impossible. get up, trinity. just get up. get up. she got out. it doesn't matter. - the informant is real. - yes. we have the name of their next target. the name is neo. we'll need a search running. it has already begun.;00:02:45,915 -->   00:06:30,013
matrix;"what? what the hell? ""follow the white rabbit.""";00:07:24,777 -->   00:07:42,836
matrix;who is it? it's choi. yeah. yeah. you're two hours late. i know. it's her fault.;00:07:54,682 -->   00:08:14,409
matrix;you got the money? two grand. hold on. hallelujah. you're my savior. my own personal jesus christ.;00:08:14,577 -->   00:08:43,146
matrix;you get caught using that ... . i know. this never happened. you don't exist. - right. - something wrong, man? you look a little whiter than usual.;00:08:43,397 -->   00:08:53,156
matrix;my computer, it ... . ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming? all the time. it's called mescaline. it's the only way to fly. it just sounds like you need to unplug.;00:08:54,283 -->   00:09:13,552
matrix;get some r and r? what do you think, dujour? should we take him with us? definitely. no, i can't. i have work tomorrow. come on. it'll be fun. i promise. yeah. sure. i'll go. hello, neo.;00:09:14,303 -->   00:10:11,026
matrix;how do you know that name? i know a lot about you. - who are you? - my name is trinity. trinity.;00:10:12,361 -->   00:10:21,202
matrix;the trinity? that cracked the lrs d-base? that was a long time ago. - jesus. - what?;00:10:22,830 -->   00:10:30,045
matrix;i just thought ...   ... you were a guy. most guys do. that was you on my computer.;00:10:30,504 -->   00:10:40,347
matrix;how did you do that? right now, all i can tell you ...   ... is that you're in danger. - i brought you here to warn you. - of what? they're watching you, neo. - who is? - please just listen. i know why you're here, neo. i know what you've been doing.;00:10:40,973 -->   00:11:03,828
matrix;i know why you hardly sleep ...   ... why you live alone and why, night after night ...   ... you sit at your computer. you're looking for him. i know, because i was once looking for the same thing.;00:11:04,080 -->   00:11:18,468
matrix;and when he found me ...   ... he told me i wasn't really looking for him ...   ... i was looking for an answer. it's the question that drives us, neo. it's the question that brought you here.;00:11:18,969 -->   00:11:34,567
matrix;you know the question ...   ... just as i did. what is the matrix? the answer is out there, neo. it's looking for you.;00:11:36,654 -->   00:11:48,331
matrix;and it will find you ...   ... if you want it to. shit. shit, shit. you have a problem with authority, mr. anderson. you believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. obviously, you are mistaken.;00:11:49,125 -->   00:12:22,323
matrix;this company is one of the top software companies in the world ...   ... because every single employee understands that they are part of a whole. thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. the time has come to make a choice, mr. anderson.;00:12:25,286 -->   00:12:42,135
matrix;either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth ...   ... or you choose to find yourself another job. do i make myself clear? yes, mr. rhineheart. perfectly clear.;00:12:43,012 -->   00:12:54,981
matrix;thomas anderson? yeah, that's me. okay. great. have a nice day.;00:13:03,115 -->   00:13:19,756
matrix;hello? hello, neo. do you know who this is? - morpheus. - yes. i've been looking for you. i don't know if you're ready to see what i want to show you. but unfortunately, you and l have run out of time. they're coming for you neo, and i don't know what they're going to do.;00:13:35,231 -->   00:13:56,960
matrix;who's coming for me? stand up and see for yourself. what? right now? yes. now. do it slowly. the elevator. - oh, shit! - yes.;00:13:57,211 -->   00:14:16,479
matrix;what the hell do they want from me? i don't know but if you don't want to find out, get out of there. how? i can guide you, but you must do exactly as i say. - okay. - the cubicle across from you is empty. - but what if they-- - go. now. stay here for just a moment.;00:14:21,151 -->   00:14:47,594
matrix;when i tell you, go to the end of the row ...   ... to the office at the end of the hall. stay as low as you can. go. now. good. now, outside there is a scaffold. - how do you know this? - we don't have time. to your left there's a window. go to it. open it. take the scaffold to the roof.;00:14:54,810 -->   00:15:38,311
matrix;no way! no way! this is crazy! there are two ways out of this building. one is that scaffold. the other is in their custody. you take a chance either way. i leave it to you.;00:15:38,562 -->   00:15:51,282
matrix;this is insane! why is this happening to me? what'd i do? i'm nobody. i didn't do anything. i'm gonna die.;00:15:54,870 -->   00:16:06,756
matrix;shit! oh, shit! i can't do this. shit. as you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, mr. anderson.;00:16:16,558 -->   00:17:53,529
matrix;it seems that you've been living ...   ... two lives. in one life, you're thomas a. anderson ...   ... program writer for a respectable software company. you have a social security number. you pay your taxes.;00:17:54,823 -->   00:18:11,714
matrix;"and you ...   ... help your landlady carry out her garbage. the other life is lived in computers ...   ... where you go by the hacker alias ""neo"" ...   ... and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. one of these lives ...   ... has a future. and one of them does not. i'm going to be as forthcoming as i can be, mr. anderson.";00:18:12,174 -->   00:18:47,792
matrix;"you're here ...   ... because we need your help. we know that you've been contacted by a certain ...   ... individual. a man who calls himself ""morpheus."" whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.";00:18:48,794 -->   00:19:11,357
matrix;he is considered by many authorities ...   ... to be the most dangerous man alive. my colleagues ...   ... believe that i am wasting my time with you. but i believe you wish to do the right thing.;00:19:11,608 -->   00:19:28,332
matrix;we're willing to wipe the slate clean ...   ... give you a fresh start. all we're asking in return is your cooperation ...   ... in bringing a known terrorist to justice. yeah. that sounds like a really good deal. but i think i got a better one.;00:19:28,625 -->   00:19:51,189
matrix;how about ...   ... i give you the finger ...   ... and you give me my phone call. mr. anderson ...   ... you disappoint me. you can't scare me with this gestapo crap. i know my rights. i want my phone call.;00:19:51,440 -->   00:20:15,463
matrix;tell me, mr. anderson ...   ... what good is a phone call ...   ... if you're unable to speak? you're going to help us, mr. anderson ...   ... whether you want to or not. this line is tapped, so i must be brief. they got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.;00:20:16,048 -->   00:22:09,243
matrix;if they knew what i know ...   ... you would probably be dead. what are you talking about? what is happening to me? you are the one, neo. you see you may have spent the last few years ...   ... looking for me, but i've spent my entire life ...   ... looking for you. now, do you still want to meet? - yes. - then go to the adams street bridge. get in.;00:22:09,494 -->   00:22:47,323
matrix;what the hell is this? it's necessary, neo. for our protection. - from what? - from you. - take off your shirt. - what? stop the car. listen to me, coppertop. we don't have time for 20 questions.;00:22:59,378 -->   00:23:17,978
matrix;right now, there's only one rule: our way ...   ... or the highway. fine. please, neo, you have to trust me. - why? - because you have been down there neo. you know that road. you know exactly where it ends. and i know that's not where you want to be. apoc, lights. lie back. lift up your shirt. - what's that? - i think you're bugged. try and relax. come on. it's on the move. come on, you shit. - you're gonna lose it. - no, i'm not.;00:23:18,480 -->   00:24:41,312
matrix;clear! jesus christ! that thing's real!? this is it. let me give you one piece of advice. be honest. he knows more than you can imagine. at last. welcome, neo.;00:24:41,480 -->   00:25:53,259
matrix;as you no doubt have guessed ...   ... i am morpheus. it's an honor to meet you.;00:25:54,469 -->   00:26:00,516
matrix;no ...   ... the honor is mine. please, come. sit.;00:26:00,976 -->   00:26:07,314
matrix;i imagine ...   ... that right now you're feeling a bit like alice ...   ... tumbling down the rabbit hole? you could say that. i can see it in your eyes.;00:26:22,414 -->   00:26:36,802
matrix;you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees ...   ... because he's expecting to wake up. ironically, this is not far from the truth.;00:26:37,387 -->   00:26:47,187
matrix;do you believe in fate, neo? no. why not? i don't like the idea that i'm not in control of my life. i know exactly what you mean. let me tell you why you're here. you are here because you know something. what you know, you can't explain. but you feel it.;00:26:47,897 -->   00:27:13,964
matrix;you felt it your entire life: that there is something wrong with the world. you don't know what it is, but it's there.;00:27:14,549 -->   00:27:21,221
matrix;like a splinter in your mind ...   ... driving you mad. it is this feeling that has brought you to me.;00:27:21,723 -->   00:27:29,730
matrix;do you know what i'm talking about? the matrix? do you want to know ...   ... what it is? the matrix is everywhere. it is all around us. even now, in this very room.;00:27:32,275 -->   00:27:52,336
matrix;you can see it when you look out your window ...   ... or when you turn on your television. you can feel it when you go to work ...   ... when you go to church ...   ... when you pay your taxes. it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes ...   ... to blind you from the truth. what truth? that you are a slave.;00:27:53,171 -->   00:28:21,782
matrix;like everyone else, you were born into bondage ...   ... born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. a prison ...   ... for your mind. unfortunately, no one can be ...   ... told what the matrix is. you have to see it for yourself. this is your last chance. after this, there is no turning back.;00:28:23,284 -->   00:29:05,242
matrix;you take the blue pill ...   ... the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe ...   ... whatever you want to believe. you take the red pill ...   ... you stay in wonderland ...   ... and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. remember ...   ... all i'm offering is the truth. nothing more. follow me.;00:29:05,702 -->   00:29:50,204
matrix;apoc, are we on-line? almost. time is always against us. please take a seat there. - you did all this? - mm-hm. the pill you took is part of a trace program. is designed to disrupt your carrier signals so we can pinpoint your location.;00:29:52,749 -->   00:30:34,706
matrix;what does that mean? it means buckle your seat belt, dorothy ...   ... because kansas ...   ... is going bye-bye. did you ... ? have you ever had a dream, neo, that you were so sure was real? what if you were unable to wake from that dream? how would you know the difference between the dream world ...   ... and the real world? this can't be.;00:30:35,250 -->   00:31:48,030
matrix;be what? be real? - going into replication. - apoc? still nothing. it's cold.;00:31:48,197 -->   00:31:59,833
matrix;it's cold! tank, we're gonna need a signal soon. - i got a fibrillation. - apoc, location. targeting almost there. he's going into arrest. - lock. i got him! - now, tank, now!;00:32:00,084 -->   00:32:20,354
matrix;welcome ...   ... to the real world. we've done it, trinity. we found him. - i hope you're right. - i don't have to hope. i know it.;00:35:17,615 -->   00:35:31,211
matrix;am i dead? far from it. he still needs a lot of work.;00:35:36,384 -->   00:35:55,485
matrix;what are you doing? your muscles have atrophied. we're rebuilding them. why do my eyes hurt? you've never used them before. rest, neo. the answers are coming.;00:35:57,029 -->   00:36:12,002
matrix;"morpheus, what's happened to me? what is this place? more important than ""what"" is ""when.""";00:37:26,577 -->   00:37:32,791
matrix;"""when""? you believe it's the year 1999 ...   ... when in fact, it's closer to 2199. i can't tell you exactly what year it is ...   ... because we honestly don't know. there's nothing i can say that will explain it for you. come with me. see for yourself. this is my ship. the nebuchadnezzar. it's a hovercraft. this is the main deck.";00:37:33,292 -->   00:38:01,278
matrix;this is the core ...   ... where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the matrix. most of my crew you already know.;00:38:07,034 -->   00:38:21,089
matrix;this is apoc ...   ... switch ...   ... and cypher. - hi. the ones you don't know: tank and his big brother, dozer. the little one behind you is mouse.;00:38:26,095 -->   00:38:39,649
matrix;you wanted to know what the matrix is? trinity. try to relax. this will feel a little weird.;00:38:43,988 -->   00:39:18,813
matrix;this ...   ... is the construct. it's our loading program.;00:39:30,785 -->   00:39:36,581
matrix;"we can load anything, from clothing ...   ... to equipment ...   ... weapons ...   ... training simulations ...   ... anything we need. right now we're inside a computer program? is it really so hard to believe? your clothes are different. the plugs in your arms and head are gone. your hair has changed. your appearance now is what we call ""residual self-image."" it is the mental projection of your digital self.";00:39:36,832 -->   00:40:08,822
matrix;"this isn't real? what is ""real""? how do you define ""real""? if you're talking about what you can feel ...   ... what you can smell, taste and see ...   ... then ""real"" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. this is the world that you know. the world as it was at the end of the 20th century.";00:40:14,703 -->   00:40:40,311
matrix;it exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation ...   ... that we call the matrix. you've been living in a dream world, neo.;00:40:42,690 -->   00:40:55,869
matrix;"this is the world ...   ... as it exists today. welcome to ""the desert ...   ... of the real."" we have only bits and pieces of information.";00:40:56,871 -->   00:41:24,272
matrix;but what we know for certain is that  at some point in the early 21st century ...   ... all of mankind was united in celebration. we marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to ai. al. you mean artificial intelligence. a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. we don't know who struck first, us or them. but we know that it was us that scorched the sky.;00:41:24,523 -->   00:41:53,760
matrix;at that time they were dependent on solar power ...   ... and it was believed that they would be unable to survive ...   ... without an energy source as abundant as the sun. throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony. the human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-voit battery. and over 25,000 btus of body heat.;00:41:55,429 -->   00:42:27,835
matrix;combined with a form of fusion ...   ... the machines had found all the energy they would ever need. there are fields, neo, endless fields ...   ... where human beings are no longer born. we are grown. for the longest time, i wouldn't believe it.;00:42:29,755 -->   00:42:59,576
matrix;and then i saw the fields with my own eyes ...   ... watched them liquefy the dead ...   ... so they could be fed intravenously to the living. and standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision ...   ... i came to realize the obviousness of the truth. what is the matrix? control.;00:42:59,827 -->   00:43:23,683
matrix;the matrix is a computer-generated dream world ...   ... built to keep us under control ...   ... in order to change a human being ...   ... into this. no. i don't believe it. it's not possible. i didn't say it would be easy, neo. i just said it would be the truth.;00:43:25,060 -->   00:43:50,918
matrix;stop! let me out! let me out! i want out! - easy, neo. easy. - get this thing out of me.;00:43:51,170 -->   00:44:01,471
matrix;get this thing out of me! don't touch me! stay away from me! i don't believe it. - he's gonna pop. - breathe, neo. just breathe.;00:44:01,722 -->   00:44:17,904
matrix;i can't go back, can i? no. but if you could ...   ... would you really want to? i feel i owe you an apology. we have a rule. we never free a mind once it's reached a certain age. it's dangerous. the mind has trouble letting go. i've seen it before, and i'm sorry.;00:44:36,298 -->   00:45:00,488
matrix;i did what i did because ...   ... i had to. when the matrix was first built, there was a man born inside ...   ... who had the ability to change whatever he wanted ...   ... to remake the matrix as he saw fit. it was he who freed the first of us ...   ... taught us the truth. as long as the matrix exists ...   ... the human race will never be free. after he died ...   ... the oracle prophesied his return ...   ... and that his coming would hail the destruction of the matrix ...   ... end the war ...   ... bring freedom to our people. that is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the matrix ...   ... looking for him. i did what i did because ...   ... i believe that search is over. get some rest. you're going to need it.;00:45:01,532 -->   00:46:22,111
matrix;for what? your training. morning. did you sleep? you will tonight. i guarantee it. i'm tank. i'll be your operator. - you don't have any -- - holes? nope. me and my brother, dozer, are 100% pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.;00:46:24,823 -->   00:47:06,072
matrix;born free right here ...   ... in the real world. genuine child of zion.;00:47:06,323 -->   00:47:11,327
matrix;- zion? - if the war was over tomorrow ...   ... zion's where the party would be. it's a city? the last human city. the only place we have left.;00:47:12,162 -->   00:47:21,504
matrix;where is it? deep underground near the earth's core, where it's still warm. you live long enough, you might see it.;00:47:23,090 -->   00:47:33,015
matrix;goddamn! i gotta tell you, i feel excited to see what you're capable of ...   ... if morpheus is right and all. we're not supposed to talk about this, but ...   ... if you are ...   ... it's a very exciting time. we got a lot to do. we gotta get to it. we're supposed to start with these operations programs first. that's major boring shit. let's do something more fun.;00:47:35,269 -->   00:48:05,172
matrix;"how about ...   ... combat training? ""jujitsu""? i'm going to learn jujitsu? holy shit! ""hey, mikey, i think he likes it.""";00:48:05,507 -->   00:48:35,494
matrix;how about some more? hell, yes. hell, yeah.;00:48:35,829 -->   00:48:41,792
matrix;how is he? ten hours straight. he's a machine. i know kung fu. show me.;00:48:53,972 -->   00:49:12,740
matrix;this is a sparring program ...   ... similar to the programmed reality of the matrix. it has the same basic rules. rules like gravity. what you must learn is that these rules are no  different than the rules in a computer system. some of them can be bent. others can be broken.;00:49:14,534 -->   00:49:30,341
matrix;understand? then hit me ...   ... if you can. good! adaptation. improvisation.;00:49:30,884 -->   00:50:19,265
matrix;but your weakness ...   ... is not your technique. morpheus is fighting neo.;00:50:19,558 -->   00:50:31,569
matrix;how did i beat you? you're too fast.;00:51:43,850 -->   00:51:52,691
matrix;do you believe that ...   ... my being stronger or faster ...   ... has anything to do with my muscles in this place? you think that's air you're breathing? again! jesus christ, he's fast! take a look at his neuro-kinetics, they are way above normal.;00:51:53,235 -->   00:52:38,279
matrix;what are you waiting for? you're faster than this. don't think you are. know you are.;00:52:43,743 -->   00:52:53,752
matrix;come on! stop trying to hit me, and hit me! i don't believe it. i know what you're trying to do. i'm trying to free your mind, neo. but i can only show you the door. you are the one who has to walk through it. tank, load the jump program.;00:53:04,139 -->   00:53:35,461
matrix;you have to let it all go, neo. fear ...   ... doubt and disbelief. free your mind. whoa. okey-dokey. free my mind.;00:53:47,057 -->   00:54:17,503
matrix;what if he makes it? - no one's ever made their first jump. - i know. - but what if he does? - he won't. come on. all right. no problem. free my mind. free my mind. no problem. right.;00:54:17,963 -->   00:54:35,020
matrix;what does that mean? it does not mean anything. everybody falls the first time.;00:54:54,416 -->   00:55:01,463
matrix;right, trin? - i thought it wasn't real. - your mind makes it real.;00:55:01,923 -->   00:55:26,530
matrix;if you're killed in the matrix ...   ... you die here? the body cannot live without the mind. i don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.;00:55:29,784 -->   00:56:10,199
matrix;there is something about him, isn't there? don't tell me you're a believer now? i just keep wondering ...   ... if morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to see the oracle? morpheus will take him when he's ready. the matrix is a system, neo. that system is our enemy. but when you're inside, you look around. what do you see? businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. the very minds of the people we are trying to save.;00:56:13,286 -->   00:56:52,783
matrix;but until we do, these people are still a part of that system ...   ... and that makes them our enemy. you have to understand ...   ... most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. and many of them are so inert ...   ... so hopelessly dependent on the system ...   ... that they will fight to protect it. were you listening to me neo or were you looking at the woman in the red dress? - i was -- - look again. freeze it. - this isn't the matrix? - no.;00:56:53,034 -->   00:57:28,360
matrix;it's another training program designed to teach you one thing: if you are not one of us, you are one of them. - what are they? - sentient programs. they can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.;00:57:30,155 -->   00:57:45,419
matrix;that means that anyone we haven't unplugged ...   ... is potentially an agent. inside the matrix ...   ... they are everyone ...   ... and they are no one. we have survived by hiding from them by running from them ...   ... but they are the gatekeepers. they're guarding all the doors. they are holding all the keys which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.;00:57:45,795 -->   00:58:09,526
matrix;someone? i won't lie to you, neo. every single man or woman who has stood their ground everyone who has fought an agent, has died. but where they have failed, you will succeed.;00:58:09,694 -->   00:58:20,579
matrix;why? i've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules.;00:58:20,747 -->   00:58:33,091
matrix;because of that ...   ... they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be. what are you trying to tell me? that i can dodge bullets? no, neo.;00:58:33,343 -->   00:58:49,816
matrix;i'm trying to tell you that when you're ready ...   ... you won't have to. we've got trouble. - did zion send a warning? - no, another ship. shit. - squiddies. we've been in crick. - squiddy? a sentinel. a killing machine designed for one thing. search and destroy. set her down right over there.;00:58:50,318 -->   00:59:37,239
matrix;how are we doing, tank? power off-line.;00:59:58,511 -->   01:00:09,896
matrix;emp armed ...   ... and ready. - emp? electromagnetic pulse. disables any electrical system in the blast radius. it's the only weapon we have against the machines. - where are we? - their old service and waste systems. sewers. they used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles. now these sewers are all that's left of them. quiet. whoa! neo. you scared the bejesus out of me. - sorry. - it's okay.;01:00:10,398 -->   01:01:29,476
matrix;is that ... ? the matrix? yeah. - do you always look at it encoded? - well, you have to. the image translators work for the construct program. but there's way too much information to decode the matrix. you get used to it. i don't even see the code. all i see is blonde, brunette, redhead.;01:01:31,979 -->   01:01:55,293
matrix;hey, you eh ...   ... want a drink? sure.;01:01:56,462 -->   01:02:00,507
matrix;you know ...   ... i know what you're thinking. because right now i'm thinking the same thing. actually, i've been thinking it ever since i got here.;01:02:04,053 -->   01:02:13,979
matrix;why, oh, why didn't i take the blue pill? good shit, huh? dozer makes it.;01:02:15,898 -->   01:02:34,750
matrix;it's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.;01:02:35,209 -->   01:02:39,713
matrix;so, can i ask you something? did he tell you why he did it? why you're here? jesus! what a mind job. so you're here to save the world.;01:02:40,715 -->   01:03:04,780
matrix;what do you say to something like that? a little piece of advice.;01:03:06,282 -->   01:03:14,915
matrix;you see an agent ...   ... you do what we do: run. you run your ass off. thanks for the drink. sweet dreams. - do we have a deal, mr. reagan?;01:03:16,709 -->   01:03:46,988
matrix;you know ...   ... i know this steak doesn't exist. i know that when i put it in my mouth ...   ... the matrix is telling my brain that it is ...     ... and delicious. after nine years ...   ... you know what i realize? ignorance is bliss.;01:03:47,657 -->   01:04:25,861
matrix;then we have a deal? i don't want to remember nothing. nothing. you understand? and i want to be rich. you know, someone important. like an actor. whatever you want, mr. reagan. okay.;01:04:28,364 -->   01:04:56,433
matrix;i get my body back in a power plant ...   ... you insert me into the matrix ...   ... i'll get you what you want. access codes to the zion mainframe. no. i told you, i don't know them. i can get you the man who does. morpheus. here you go, buddy. breakfast of champions. if you close your eyes, it almost feels like you're eating runny eggs. yeah, or a bowl of snot.;01:04:56,809 -->   01:05:34,220
matrix;do you know what it really reminds me of? tasty wheat. did you ever eat tasty wheat? no, but technically, neither did you. that's exactly my point. exactly.;01:05:36,057 -->   01:05:44,648
matrix;because you have to wonder now...   ... how do the machines really know what tasty wheat tasted like? maybe they got it wrong.;01:05:44,899 -->   01:05:53,281
matrix;maybe what i think tasty wheat tasted like, actually tasted like ...   ... oatmeal or tuna fish. that makes you wonder about a lot of things. you take chicken, for example.;01:05:53,574 -->   01:06:01,039
matrix;maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like ...   ... which is why chicken tastes like everything. - maybe they couldn't figure out -- - shut up, mouse.;01:06:01,290 -->   01:06:08,463
matrix;it's a single-cell protein ...   ... combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals. everything the body needs. it doesn't have everything the body needs. so i understand you've run through the agent training program. you know, i wrote that program. here it comes.;01:06:08,714 -->   01:06:29,109
matrix;- what did you think of her? - of who? the woman in the red dress? i designed her.;01:06:29,485 -->   01:06:35,615
matrix;she, uhm, well she doesn't talk very much ...   ... but if you'd like to meet her, i can arrange a much more personalized meeting. digital pimp, hard at work. pay no attention to these hypocrites, neo.;01:06:35,866 -->   01:06:47,085
matrix;to deny our own impulses ...   ... is to deny the very thing that makes us human. dozer, when you're done ...   ... bring the ship up to broadcast depth. we're going in. taking neo to see her.;01:06:47,336 -->   01:07:04,769
matrix;see who? the oracle.;01:07:05,771 -->   01:07:14,070
matrix;"everyone please observe ...   ... the ""fasten seat belt"" and ""no smoking"" signs have been turned on. sit back and enjoy your ride. we're in. we'll be back in an hour.";01:07:14,405 -->   01:08:20,011
matrix;unbelievable ...   ... isn't it? - god! - what? i used to eat there. really good noodles. i have these memories from my life. none of them happened.;01:08:20,262 -->   01:08:46,329
matrix;what does that mean? that the matrix cannot tell you who you are. and the oracle can? that's different.;01:08:46,580 -->   01:08:58,550
matrix;did you go to her? yes.;01:09:00,094 -->   01:09:03,138
matrix;what did she tell you? she told me.... what? we're here. neo, come with me.;01:09:06,392 -->   01:09:40,300
matrix;so is this the same oracle that made ...   ... the prophecy? yes. she's very old. she's been with us since the beginning. - the beginning? - of the resistance.;01:09:40,467 -->   01:09:53,396
matrix;and she knows what? everything? she would say she knows enough. and she's never wrong. try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong. she is a guide, neo. she can help you to find the path.;01:09:55,441 -->   01:10:11,581
matrix;she helped you? yes.;01:10:12,291 -->   01:10:15,418
matrix;what did she tell you? that i would find the one. i told you i can only show you the door. you have to walk through it. hello, neo. you're right on time. make yourself at home, morpheus. neo, come with me. these are the other potentials. you can wait here. do not try and bend the spoon. that's impossible. instead, only try to realize the truth.;01:10:17,880 -->   01:11:58,354
matrix;what truth? there is no spoon.;01:11:58,605 -->   01:12:04,193
matrix;there is no spoon? then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends. it is only yourself. the oracle will see you now. i know you're neo. be right with you. - you're the oracle? - bingo.;01:12:04,445 -->   01:12:49,489
matrix;not quite what you were expecting, right? almost done.;01:12:50,532 -->   01:12:56,829
matrix;smell good, don't they? yeah. i'd ask you to sit down ...   ... but you're not going to anyway. - and don't worry about the vase. - what vase? that vase. i'm sorry. i said don't worry about it. i'll get one of my kids to fix it.;01:12:58,082 -->   01:13:20,812
matrix;how did you know? what's really going to bake your noodle later on is ...   ... would you still have broken it if i hadn't said anything? you're cuter than i thought. i can see why she likes you.;01:13:22,856 -->   01:13:43,918
matrix;who? not too bright, though. you know why morpheus brought you to see me.;01:13:44,169 -->   01:13:55,680
matrix;so ...   ... what do you think? do you think you are the one? honestly, i don't know.;01:13:56,640 -->   01:14:09,444
matrix;"you know what that means? it's latin. means ""know thyself."" i'm going to let you in on a little secret. being the one is just like being in love.";01:14:10,279 -->   01:14:27,128
matrix;no one can tell you you're in love. you just know it ...   ... through and through. balls to bones.;01:14:27,379 -->   01:14:34,260
matrix;"well ...   ... i'd better have a look at you. open your mouth. say, ""ah.""";01:14:36,221 -->   01:14:57,200
matrix;"okay ... . now i'm supposed to say, ""hmm, that's interesting, but...."" then you say... but what? but you already know what i'm going to tell you. - i'm not the one. - sorry, kid.";01:14:57,826 -->   01:15:18,513
matrix;you got the gift ...   ... but it looks like you're waiting for something. what? your next life, maybe. who knows? that's the way these things go. - what's funny? - morpheus. he, he almost had me convinced. i know. poor morpheus. without him, we're lost.;01:15:19,431 -->   01:15:56,300
matrix;"what do you mean, ""without him""? are you sure you want to hear this? morpheus believes in you, neo.";01:16:00,305 -->   01:16:11,065
matrix;and no one, not you, not even me ...   ... can convince him otherwise. he believes it so blindly ...   ... that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours. what? you're going to have to make a choice. in the one hand, you'll have morpheus' life. and in the other hand, you'll have your own. one of you is going to die. which one will be up to you. i'm sorry, kiddo. i really am. you have a good soul. and i hate giving good people bad news. oh, don't worry about it.;01:16:11,316 -->   01:16:58,112
matrix;as soon as you step outside that door ...   ... you'll start feeling better. you'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap. you're in control of your own life.;01:16:58,363 -->   01:17:10,708
matrix;remember? here ...   ... take a cookie. i promise, by the time you're done eating it ...   ... you'll feel right as rain. what was said ...   ... was for you ...   ... and for you alone. they're on the way.;01:17:12,377 -->   01:18:34,125
matrix;what is that? whoa, dã©jã  vu.;01:18:48,890 -->   01:18:54,895
matrix;what did you just say? nothing. i just had a little dã©jã  vu. - what did you see? - what happened? a black cat went past us ...   ...and then another that looked just like it. how much like it, was it the same cat? - might have been, i'm not sure. - switch, apoc.;01:18:55,147 -->   01:19:14,874
matrix;what is it? a dã©jã  vu is usually a glitch in the matrix. it happens when they change something. oh, my god. let's go. they cut the hard line. it's a trap! get out! - oh, no. - oh, no. that's what they changed. we're trapped. there's no way out be calm. give me your phone. they'll be able to track it. we have no choice. operator. tank. find a structural drawing of this building. find it fast. - got it! - i need the main wet-wall. eighth floor. they're on the eighth floor. switch, straight ahead.;01:19:15,125 -->   01:20:54,431
matrix;neo ... . i hope the oracle gave you some good news. then left. that's it. good.;01:21:00,564 -->   01:21:24,837
matrix;where are they? shh. they're in the walls.;01:22:25,273 -->   01:22:29,068
matrix;they're in the walls! it's an agent! morpheus! you must get neo out! he's all that matters! - no. no, morpheus! don't! - trinity, go!;01:22:50,465 -->   01:23:09,066
matrix;go! - we can't leave him! - we have to! cypher, come on! the great morpheus. we meet at last.;01:23:15,323 -->   01:23:53,777
matrix;and you are? a smith. agent smith. you all look the same to me. take him.;01:23:54,029 -->   01:25:04,973
matrix;no! - operator. - yeah, i need an exit, fast. - cypher? - yeah, there was an accident. goddamn car accident. all of a sudden, boom. somebody up there still likes me. i gotcha. get me out of here fast. intersection of franklin and erie. an old tv repair shop. right. - operator. - tank, it's me.;01:25:10,105 -->   01:25:34,962
matrix;is morpheus alive? is morpheus alive, tank? yes, they're moving him. i don't know where to yet he's alive. we need an exit. you're not far from cypher. - cypher? - i know. - he's at franklin and erie. - got it. got him.;01:25:35,338 -->   01:26:08,829
matrix;where are they? making the call. good.;01:26:09,080 -->   01:26:26,555
matrix;you first, neo shit! tank! no! i don't know. it just went dead. hello, trinity.;01:26:29,767 -->   01:27:11,600
matrix;cypher? where's tank? you know ...   ... for a long time ...   ... i thought i was in love with you. i used to dream about you. you're a beautiful woman, trinity. too bad things had to turn out this way. you killed them. - what? - oh, god. i'm tired, trinity.;01:27:17,190 -->   01:27:43,966
matrix;i'm tired of this war ...   ...i'm tired of fighting. i'm tired of this ship ...   ...being cold, eating the same goddamn goop every day. but most of all ...   ... i'm tired of that jack-off and all of his bullshit. surprise, asshole! i bet you never saw this coming ...   ... did you? god, i wish i could be there ...   ... when they break you. i wish i could walk in just when it happens ...   ... so right then ...   ... you'd know it was me. you gave them morpheus. he lied to us, trinity.;01:27:44,259 -->   01:28:26,258
matrix;he tricked us! if you had told us the truth ...   ... we would've told you to shove that red pill up your ass! that is not true, cypher. he set us free.;01:28:26,801 -->   01:28:37,436
matrix;free? you call this free? all i do is what he tells me to do.;01:28:39,856 -->   01:28:46,862
matrix;if i had to choose between that and the matrix ...   ... i choose the matrix. the matrix isn't real. i disagree, trinity.;01:28:48,031 -->   01:28:55,329
matrix;i think the matrix ...   ...could be more real than this world. all i do is pull the plug here.;01:28:55,663 -->   01:29:04,504
matrix;but there ...   ... you have to watch apoc die. trinity. - welcome to the real world, baby? - but you're out, cypher. - you can't go back. - oh no, that's what you think. they're going to reinsert my body. i go back to sleep and when i wake up, i won't remember a goddamn thing.;01:29:05,048 -->   01:29:27,611
matrix;by the way ...   ... if you have anything terribly important to say to switch ...   ...i suggest you say it now. - no, please don't. - not like this. not like this. too late.;01:29:27,862 -->   01:29:46,588
matrix;goddamn you, cypher! don't hate me, trinity. i'm just the messenger. and right now, i'm going  to prove it to you.;01:29:46,839 -->   01:29:57,307
matrix;if morpheus was right ...   ...then there's no way i can pull this plug. i mean if neo's the one ...   ... then there'd have to be ...   ... some kind of a miracle to stop me. right? i mean, how can he be the one ...   ... if he's dead? you never did answer me before ...   ... if you bought into morpheus' bullshit. come on, all i want is a little yes or no.;01:29:57,850 -->   01:30:25,877
matrix;look into his eyes ...   ... those big, pretty eyes ...   ... tell me ...   ... yes ...   ... or no? - yes. - no! i don't believe it.;01:30:26,629 -->   01:30:46,231
matrix;believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still gonna to burn! you first. - you're hurt. - i'll be all right.;01:31:04,500 -->   01:31:20,348
matrix;dozer? have you ever stood and stared at it? marveled at its beauty ...   ... its genius? billions of people ...   ... just living out their lives. oblivious.;01:31:38,618 -->   01:32:03,850
matrix;did you know that the first matrix ...   ... was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered ...   ... where everyone would be happy. it was a disaster. no one would accept the program. entire crops were lost.;01:32:04,101 -->   01:32:21,451
matrix;some believe that ...  ... we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. but i believe that ...  ... as a species ...  ... human beings define their reality through misery ...  ... and suffering. the perfect world would dream ...   ... that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. which is why the matrix was redesigned to this.;01:32:21,702 -->   01:32:49,938
matrix;"the peak ...   ... of your civilization. i say, ""your civilization"" ...   ... because as soon as we started thinking for you, it became our civilization ...   ... which is, of course, what this is all about. evolution, morpheus. evolution. like the dinosaur. look out that window. you had your time. the future is our world, morpheus. the future is our time. there could be a problem. - what are they doing to him? - breaking into his mind. it's like hacking a computer. all it takes is time.";01:32:50,189 -->   01:33:39,112
matrix;how much time? depends on the mind. eventually, it will crack ...  ...and his alpha patterns will change from this to this. when it does, morpheus tell them anything they want to know.;01:33:39,363 -->   01:33:51,666
matrix;well, what do they want? the leader of every ship is given codes to zion's mainframe computer.;01:33:51,917 -->   01:33:59,132
matrix;if an agent got the codes and got into zion's mainframe ...  ...they could destroy us. we can't let that happen. trinity, zion's more important than me ...   ... or you ...   ... or even morpheus. well, there has to be something we can do. there is. we pull the plug.;01:33:59,383 -->   01:34:20,403
matrix;you're going to kill him? kill morpheus? we don't have a choice. never send a human to do a machine's job.;01:34:20,655 -->   01:34:35,794
matrix;if the insider has failed ...   ... they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless -- they're dead. in either case -- we have no choice but to continue as planned. deploy the sentinels. immediately. morpheus, you're more than a leader to us. you're our father. we'll miss you always.;01:34:36,045 -->   01:35:09,035
matrix;stop! i don't believe this is happening. - neo, this has to be done. - does it? i don't know. - this can't be just coincidence. it can't be. - what are you talking about? the oracle. she told me this would happen. she told me that i would have to make a choice.;01:35:10,204 -->   01:35:28,471
matrix;what choice? - what are you doing? - i'm going in. - no, you're not. - i have to. neo, morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out. there's no way that  you're going back in. morpheus did what he did because he believed i am something i'm not.;01:35:31,475 -->   01:35:49,033
matrix;what? i'm not the one, trinity. - the oracle hit me with that too. - no, you have to be. i'm sorry, i'm not. i'm just another guy. no, neo, that's not true. - it can't be true. - why? neo, this is loco. they've got morpheus in a military-controlled building. even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. three of them. i want morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.;01:35:49,744 -->   01:36:22,192
matrix;that's what it looks like ...   ... but it's not. i can't explain to you why it's not. morpheus believed something, and he was  ready to give his life for what he believed. i understand that now. but that's why i have to go. - why? - because i believe in something.;01:36:22,359 -->   01:36:38,666
matrix;what? i believe i can bring him back. - what are you doing? - i'm going with you. - no, you're not. - no? let me tell you what i believe. morpheus means more to me than he does to you. i believe if you were really serious about saving him, you are going to need my help.;01:36:39,376 -->   01:37:15,370
matrix;and since i am the ranking officer on this ship ...   ... if you don't like it, i believe you can go to hell. because you aren't going anywhere else.;01:37:15,621 -->   01:37:23,628
matrix;tank ...   ... load us up. i'd like to share a revelation that i've had ...   ... during my time here. it came to me when i tried to classify your species ...   ...i realized ...   ... that you're not actually mammals. every mammal on this planet ...   ... instinctively develops a natural  equilibrium with the surrounding environment. but you humans do not.;01:37:23,796 -->   01:38:05,211
matrix;you move to an area and you multiply ...   ... and multiply until every natural resource is consumed. the only way you can survive ...   ... is to spread to another area. there is another organism on this planet ...   ... that follows the same pattern. do you know what it is? a virus. human beings are a disease. a cancer of this planet. you are a plague.;01:38:05,462 -->   01:38:41,289
matrix;and we ...   ... are the cure. okay, so what do you need? besides a miracle. guns. lots of guns.;01:38:41,457 -->   01:39:01,935
matrix;neo ... . no one has ever done anything like this. that's why it's going to work.;01:39:03,687 -->   01:39:15,365
matrix;why isn't the serum working? perhaps we're asking the wrong questions. leave me with him. now. hold on, morpheus. they're coming for you. they're coming.;01:39:15,991 -->   01:39:45,603
matrix;can you hear me, morpheus? i'm going to be honest ...   ... with you. i ...   ... hate ...   ... this place ...   ... this zoo ...   ... this prison ...   ... this reality, whatever you want to call it. i can't stand it any longer. it's the smell. if there is such a thing. i feel saturated by it.;01:39:45,854 -->   01:40:22,390
matrix;i can ...   ... taste ...   ... your stink. and every time i do, i feel i have  somehow been infected by it. it's repulsive.;01:40:22,641 -->   01:40:33,818
matrix;isn't it? i must get out of here. i must get free. and in this mind is the key. my key. once zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.;01:40:35,988 -->   01:40:50,960
matrix;don't you understand? i need the codes. i have to get inside zion ...   ... and you have to tell me how. you're going to tell me ...   ... or you're going to die. would you please remove any metallic items you're carrying. keys, loose change.;01:40:51,253 -->   01:41:31,042
matrix;holy shit! backup. send backup.;01:41:43,138 -->   01:42:10,790
matrix;freeze! what were you doing? he doesn't know.;01:44:25,634 -->   01:44:31,722
matrix;know what? i think they're trying to save him. there is no spoon.;01:44:59,793 -->   01:45:50,676
matrix;find them and destroy them! i repeat, we're under attack! trinity! help! only human. dodge this.;01:45:52,304 -->   01:47:09,004
matrix;- how did you do that? - do what? you moved like they do. i've never seen anyone move that fast. wasn't fast enough.;01:47:09,423 -->   01:47:19,890
matrix;can you fly that thing? not yet. operator. tank, i need a pilot program for a b-212 helicopter. hurry. let's go. no. morpheus, get up. get up, get up. he's not going to make it. gotcha.;01:47:21,017 -->   01:50:48,599
matrix;trinity! i knew it. he's the one.;01:51:30,266 -->   01:51:51,704
matrix;do you believe it now, trinity? morpheus ... . the oracle.;01:51:54,582 -->   01:52:02,131
matrix;- she told me i'm-- - she told you...   ...exactly what you needed to hear. that's all.;01:52:02,507 -->   01:52:09,722
matrix;neo, sooner or later you're going  to realize, just as i did ...   ... there's a difference between knowing the path ...   ... and walking the path. - operator. - tank. - it's good to hear your voice, sir. - we need an exit. got one ready. subway station, state and balboa. - damn it! - the trace was completed. - we have their position. - the sentinels are standing by. order the strike. they're not out yet. you first, morpheus.;01:52:10,056 -->   01:53:31,720
matrix;neo, i want to tell you something ...   ... but i'm afraid of what it could mean if i do. everything the oracle told me has come true. everything but this.;01:53:34,974 -->   01:53:52,658
matrix;but what? neo! - what the hel just happened? - an agent. - you have to send me back. - i can't. mr. anderson. run, neo. run.;01:54:17,559 -->   01:54:37,286
matrix;what is he doing? he's beginning to believe. you're empty. so are you.;01:54:37,537 -->   01:55:45,187
matrix;i'm going to enjoy watching you die ...   ... mr. anderson. jesus, he's killing him. do you hear that, mr. anderson? that is the sound of inevitability. that is the sound of your death. goodbye, mr. anderson.;01:55:46,314 -->   01:58:13,502
matrix;my name ...   ... is neo. - what happened? - i don't know. i lost him. oh, shit. sentinels. - how long? - five, maybe six minutes. tank, charge the emp. - you can't use that until he's out. - i know. don't worry. he's gonna make it.;01:58:16,506 -->   01:59:25,282
matrix;flat or pumps? no, just -- what the -? shit, that's my phone! that guy took my phone! got him! he's on the run. mr. wizard, get me the hell out of here! got a patch on an old exit. wabash and lake.;01:59:25,533 -->   01:59:45,093
matrix;oh, shit! help! need a little help! the door. the door on your left.;02:00:06,657 -->   02:00:31,139
matrix;no, your other left! back door. oh, no. here they come. he's going to make it. fire escape at the end of the alley, room 303. they're inside. hurry, neo. can't be. check him. he's gone. goodbye, mr. anderson.;02:00:37,855 -->   02:03:56,970
matrix;neo ... . i'm not afraid anymore.;02:03:58,431 -->   02:04:03,351
matrix;the oracle told me ...   ...that i would fall in love, and that that man, the man that i loved would be the one. and so you see ...   ... you can't be dead. you can't be ...   ... because i love you. you hear me? i love you. now get up. no.;02:04:03,519 -->   02:05:32,857
matrix;how? he is the one.;02:05:33,734 -->   02:07:02,989
matrix;neo! i know you're out there. i can feel you now. i know that you're afraid. you're afraid of us. you're afraid of change. i don't know the future. i didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. i came here to tell you how it's going to begin. i'm going to hang up this phone. and then i'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.;02:07:59,254 -->   02:08:26,030
